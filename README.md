# MyFridge

MyFridge is a helper mobile app to automate your fridge pipeline: always knowing which products remain, their best-before dates, what you can prepare from them, and helping when you go grocery shopping.

## MVP Features
- List of products (inventory view)
- Add new product (name, quantity, best-before date)

## Tech Decisions
- UI: SwiftUI
- Architecture: MVVM
- Data: Local persistence (on-device storage)

## Run / Dev
1. Open the Xcode workspace/project in Xcode.
2. Build and run on a simulator or device.

Example:

```bash
open MyFridge.xcodeproj
# Or open the workspace if you use Swift packages: open MyFridge.xcworkspace
```
